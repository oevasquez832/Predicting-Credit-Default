# FINAL_PROJECT

Credit Card Defaults

Use the default payments dataset to predict the likelihood of future default rates base on characteristics of borrowers (e.g. age, sex, marriage, education,…). 

Dataset to include: Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository

Project Plan steps
•    Use python/SQL to create usable dataset, 
•    Use Tableau to create visualizations of the data
•    Perform Machine Learning testing, 
•    Webpage with Conclusion –characteristics of the best and worse borrowers

# Predicting-Credit-Default

This project uses data from Lending Club to predict the probability of credit default based on a person's characteristics. Machine learning algorithms used are: logistics regression and random trees from Python's sci-kit learn package. Analysis and conclusion of study is then presented on a website optimized for tablet viewing created using Javascript components.
